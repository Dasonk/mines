Mines
=====

A minesweeper clone for R built using gWidgetsRGtk2

## Installation

Currently there isn't a release on [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/).


You can, however, download the [zip ball](https://github.com/Dasonk/Mines/zipball/master) or [tar ball](https://github.com/Dasonk/Mines/tarball/master), decompress and run `R CMD INSTALL` on it, or use the **devtools** package to install the development version:

```r
## Make sure your current packages are up to date
update.packages()
## devtools is required
library(devtools)
install_github("Mines", "Dasonk")
```

Note: Windows users need [Rtools](http://www.murdoch-sutherland.com/Rtools/) and [devtools](http://CRAN.R-project.org/package=devtools) to install this way.
